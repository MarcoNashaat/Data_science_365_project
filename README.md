# Tracking User Engagement with SQL, Excel, and Python
This project focuses on comparing and analyzing student engagement between Q2 2021 and Q2 2022 using SQL, Excel, and Python. The goal is to predict the number of certificates earned based on the time spent by students on courses.

# Project Overview
The project involves three main stages:

## Data Preparation (SQL):

SQL was used to extract and prepare the data, creating views and tables for analysis.
Data was exported to CSV files for further analysis in Excel and Python.

## Initial Data Analysis (Excel):

Excel was used for initial data analysis, including:
Correlation analysis between variables.
Hypothesis testing to determine relationships.

## Data Preprocessing and Modeling (Python):

Outlier detection and removal were performed using Python for preprocessing.
A linear regression model was developed to predict the number of certificates based on the number of minutes spent on courses.
Python libraries like pandas, numpy, and sklearn were utilized for the modeling and analysis stages.

## Statistical Analysis (SQL):

SQL queries were used to calculate probabilities, conditional probabilities, and analyze the dependence between different variables.

# Technologies Used
SQL: Data extraction, preparation, and statistical analysis.
Excel: Initial data analysis, correlation, and hypothesis testing.
Python: Data preprocessing, linear regression model, and outlier removal.

# Files Included
SQL Scripts: Scripts for data preparation, creating views and tables, and analyzing relationships between variables.
Excel Files: Analysis results from correlation tests and hypothesis testing.
Python Scripts: Data preprocessing (outlier removal), model creation, and analysis.
